In this week's Sprint Retrospective, we reviewed our task of generating a user login and registration page for our stock trading website. The greatest achievement of the week was the effective distribution of tasks among team members, where everyone found a segment they were interested in and skilled at, significantly boosting work efficiency and team morale. However, our main challenge was a lack of familiarity with the processes and technologies involved in frontend and backend interaction, which became an obstacle in our implementation process. To overcome this issue, the team plans to enhance our capabilities by thoroughly reading relevant technical documentation and engaging in technical exchanges, ensuring that we can effectively implement seamless frontend and backend integration. This experience has highlighted the importance of continuous learning and provided valuable insights for our future development work.
