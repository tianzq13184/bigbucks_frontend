During Sprint 2, our team achieved significant progress. Yuqi Wang led our front-end development, ensuring a user-friendly interface. Yutong Amber Sun managed front and back end integration, working closely with the front-end team. The backend was developed by Yinuo Yan and Zichao Chen, who established our server-side operations. Leyao Jia was responsible for the database and its backend integration, setting up a robust data management system. We also managed GitLab issues effectively, opening and closing two issues to streamline development. Furthermore, we updated the UML use case and class diagrams, reflecting our current system architecture and aiding in project communication.
