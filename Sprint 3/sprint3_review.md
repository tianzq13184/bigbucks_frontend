In our recent work, we've made notable progress by developing a dynamic React validation template for the registration and login interfaces, ensuring user-friendly interaction and data security. The corresponding back-end code was efficiently implemented to manage user authentication processes securely. Additionally, we've planned the project's overall structure and functionalities, and prepared a database with user, stock, and data tables to support the application's core operations. We've also enhanced the project by introducing a Python runtime environment, which will facilitate future backend processes and data analysis.
