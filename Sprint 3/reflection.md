reelectionï¼šThis week, our team focused on utilizing the React framework to construct the frontend of the registration page, while the backend was developed using the Flask framework. Additionally, we made progress in setting up a portion of the database. A significant challenge we encountered involved the creation of interfaces for frontend and backend communication. To address this, we attempted to establish connections through these interfaces. Our key takeaway from this week's sprint retrospective is the importance of frequent communication to promptly address and resolve issues. This experience underscored the necessity of maintaining open lines of communication within the team to ensure seamless integration between different components of our project.
