In Sprint Week 4, our team is focusing on four main tasks:

Develop a new feature for querying historical data across both frontend and backend. This feature is crucial for users to access and analyze past data insights.
Debug and enhance the frontend and backend connection to solidify our progress from Week 3. Essential for a seamless user experience, requiring close teamwork to resolve any issues.
Integrate the database with the user registration and login interfaces, a task pending assignment. This is key for robust user management and security.
Test the registration and login features rigorously, including crafting test case documents and logging results. This ensures these critical functions perform flawlessly.
Additionally, backend development will focus on advancing as much as possible to maintain momentum. We'll also consider adding admin functionalities in registration after primary goals are achieved, and emphasize accelerating our pace to stay on schedule.

Our aim for Week 4 is straightforward: achieve significant development milestones, improve user access and security, and ensure backend and frontend integration is flawless.
